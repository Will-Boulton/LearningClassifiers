###Learning machine learning classifiers

------------

This is a collection of classifiers written in Python 2.7 I am implementing to get an understanding of different classification methods/algorithms

Implemented so far:
- K Nearest neighbours classifier.
- Decision Tree classifier.
- Naive Bayes Classifier with gaussian distribution.
